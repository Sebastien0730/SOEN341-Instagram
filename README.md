# SOEN341-Instagram

## Objective
Develop an Instagram-plus web page.

## Description
The goal of the project is to develop a simplified version of the Instagram application. The implementation of the application will have to include the core features of Instagram. Those features are going to be listed down below. While also adding the 3 basic features, we will have to come up with a new feature to add to the infrastructure of our web app. Our new feature will have to do with the reposting of pictures. It will explained in more detail, in a different section of the README. The list of technologies that will be used are also listed down below. That list will be continually updated as we determine how we will develop our web app.
